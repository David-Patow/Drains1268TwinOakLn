# Drains1268TwinOakLn

Here's a quick tour of the ditches and drains around 1268 Twin Oak Ln, after a typical rainfall.

In brief, I think there are 4 spots that need attention.  Due to these blockages, all the rainwater overflows the Twin Oak Ln ditch, flows across the lawn, collects back in the Weber Ln drain, then exits by a single, 8" conduit.

As the Twin Oak Ln ditch does not have a proper outflow, it is usually filled with water, even during dry times, which breeds mosquitoes.

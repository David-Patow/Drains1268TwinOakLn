# Drains1268TwinOakLn

Here's a quick tour of the ditches and drains around 1268 Twin Oak Ln, after a typical rainfall.

In brief, I think there are 4 spots that need attention.  Due to these blockages, all the rainwater overflows the Twin Oak Ln ditch, flows across the lawn, collects back in the Weber Ln drain, then exits by a single, 8" conduit.

As the Twin Oak Ln ditch does not have a proper outflow, it is usually filled with water, even during dry times, which breeds mosquitoes.

Photo C : The ditches on Twin Oak Ln, full from rainfall.  The same-level water implies that there is no blockage under the driveway.

Photo F : The higher water level on the close side of the driveway implies that the conduit here is blocked.  Further, there is no evidence of outflow from the far ditch segment.

Photo G : At the corner of Smith Rd and Weber Ln, there is no obvious pipe, yet I see a small bit of percolating water.  Is the pipe covered-up?

Photo R : Backing up Weber Ln towards Smith Rd, to see the ditch behind 1268 Twin Oak Ln.  This area is currently being cleared of overgrown garden by the homeowner.  It is not part of this problem, as very little water flows **through** this blocked ditch.
